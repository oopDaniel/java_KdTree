# Kd Tree

## a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square

Support efficient range search and nearest neighbor search

- Brute-force: using a red-black BST (Set).
- Efficient: using a 2d-tree

## Compile

`javac -cp <path-to-algs4.jar> PointSET.java KdTree.java`

## Usage

- `java KdTree`

Time complexity for *search* and *nearest* `KdTree` should be: *O(log(n))*
